### MTM

- A healthcare provider *must* to complete a [statement of medical need](materials/statement-of-medical-need.pdf)
	- A Statement of Medical Need is used when a client needs to ride in a medical taxi or needs to be accompanied by another person to appointments. 
	- MTM faxes the form to the PCP (primary care physician). 
	- The PCP must fill out form and fax it to MTM as soon as possible. 
- You can use a [table in English](materials/calling-a-taxi-cheat-sheet.xlsx) or [Spanish](https://github.com/ColtonGrainger/ymca-resources/blob/master/materials/calling-a-taxi-cheat-sheet-spanish.xlsx) for the calling. Phone: 855 687 4786.
- *Don't tell MTM if your client is going to Physical Therapy!* (Tell them it's a primary care doctor or an orthopedic doctor.)
- Make sure you schedule a taxi at least **48 hours** in advance. 
	- Otherwise, MTM will not be able to guarantee transportation until a spot opens up.
- If you cannot communicate in English:
	- Call the number (855-687-4786) and you will be asked to enter the client’s Medicaid ID number. 
	- Enter this and wait.
	- A representative will come on the line. 
	- Once a customer representative answers, say, “I do not speak English. I speak (language). Please help me.” 
	- You will then be transferred to an interpreter who will assist you. 
- Before you call, have all the relevant information ready in front of you. 
	- Medicaid ID # for person who needs the transportation
	- Date of Birth of person
	- Name of person
	- Physical Address of person
		- If address is 6300 Westpark Drive, YMCA’s address, change it to your address so you will be picked up from your house. 
		-You will need to call 2-1-1 later to report the address change too.
	- Phone number where person can be reached. (This is for the taxi company so they can contact the person directly)
	- Date and time of your appointment
	- Address of where appointment will be
	- Phone number of the appointment’s location
	- What kind of appointment is it? (For example, annual check-up, cardiologist, chest x-ray, etc)
- When you call (855-687-4786)
	1. First you will be asked Medicaid ID # for person who needs the transportation
	2. Second you will be asked to verify name of person and date of birth
	3. Third you will be asked to verify address and phone number
	4. Fourth you will be asked what day and time is the appointment.
	5. Fifth you will be asked where the appointment is and the telephone number for the location.
	6. If you need to ride in a taxi or paralift, or you need an additional passenger, tell them.
		- Most likely, they will send the statement of medical need to your PCP. PCP must fax it back to MTM. Once it is received, they will allow transportation to proceed for the person. 
	7. When transportation is arranged, ask for the name and phone number of the taxi company.
		- Sometimes, if you don’t have any medical issues/communication issues, your option for transportation may be the bus. If this is the case, the bus pass will be mailed to your home address.

# Healthcare

## Primary Care Providers (PCPs)
Here's [A Map of Primary Care Providers](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kk9yn6-4nifHLIf2tGYbW_7PiYo&usp=sharing).

### [Advice for doctor's appointments](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amino/2016/03/12/how-to-make-every-minute-count-at-your-doctors-appointment/print/) 
adapted from Sabrina Kang's 3/12/2016 *Forbes* article
- **Prepare a list of questions.**
- **Know [your client's] medications** or, even better, bring them to the appointment. 
- **Be honest.** If there’s a stressful thing happening at work or home that’s preventing [your client] from sticking to their medications, diet or exercise, *share that information.* 
- **Figure out next steps.** Wrap up your appointment with an understanding of what your client need to do next. Repeat it aloud.
- **Get a visit summary (and a copy of any referrals).** A written record or an after-visit summary makes it more likely that your client will get their concerns addressed by the next visit. It's also proof that your client is *actively* seeking treatment for their medical conditions.

## Healthcare Coverage

**RMA Interpretation FAQ**

1. Some of my clients are more comfortable speaking a language other than English when talking with a healthcare provider. Does the Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA) program in Texas offer interpreting services? 

Interpreting services may be offered by the healthcare provider, local resettlement agency or other community resources. If language services, are not otherwise available, the case manager can request interpreting services for a medical appointment through the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI) by completing the Interpreter Request Form. 

2. How can I get access to interpreting services on behalf of my client?

To request interpreting services for your client’s scheduled medical appointment, please complete the [Interpreter Request Form](materials/rma-interp.docx). The form must be submitted to RMAlanguageservices@uscridc.org at least three days prior to the appointment date. If the request is approved, you will receive an email stating that an interpreter will call the healthcare provider at the time of your client’s medical appointment. If the request is not approved, you will receive an email indicating the reason. 

3. Who is eligible to receive interpreting services under Refugee Medical Assistance?

To be eligible for interpreting services, a client must be eligible to receive RMA health benefits within the state of Texas, have a scheduled medical appointment in a location that does not currently offer interpreter services, and submit a completed Interpreter Request Form at least three days in advance of his or her appointment. 

4. Who will pay for the interpreting service? 

USCRI will pay for this language interpreting service with RMA program funds. You and your client will not be responsible for any charges incurred if you are using the telephonic interpreting service we provide. USCRI does not currently reimburse other interpreting services that are used during a health encounter. 

5. What should I do if my client’s appointment has been cancelled?

If your client’s appointment has been cancelled or they are unable to keep the appointment, please inform USCRI as soon as you find out by sending an email to RMAlanguageservices@uscridc.org. The email should include your client’s name, date and time of the appointment, the language requested and the healthcare provider’s name. USCRI will monitor cancelled requests for interpreting services to identify program improvement opportunities. 

6. What should I do if my client or I have issues or concerns with the interpreting service? 

USCRI is committed to culturally and linguistically competent health services. If you or your client have any concerns about the quality of interpreting services, please send an email to RMAlanguageservices@uscridc.org. The email should include a brief description of the specific concern, your client’s name, date and time of the appointment, the language requested and the healthcare provider’s name. This information will help us follow up in a timely manner and address any concerns. 

**RMA Transportation**

- For Transportation use [the attached form](materials/rma-transport.docx) and send it to rmatransportation@uscridc.org three business days before the appointment. 
- At least 3 days advanced notice is required for any trip request. Any question or concern, please e-mail Ryan Yao
	- ryao@uscridc.org
	- or call 703-310-1130 x3060.
- Please include client’s name, contact information, pick-up address, and drop-off address on the request form. 
- If the pick-up location is in a gated/secured community, please provide all the necessary information to Amera Solutions, such as front gate code, apartment number, or alternative pick-up location, which is public accessible, for instance, leasing office, in the Comments/Notes section.
- Please note: If the driver cannot locate the client/patient at the pick-up location at the requested time, the driver will contact both the client and individual who made the request. If neither cannot be reached, the trip will be cancelled.
- Any trip to non-RMA covered medical provider or service will not be covered under the plan.
- All trip requests will be reviewed and approved by USCRI, prior to service. 


### Gold Card
The [Harris Health Financial Assistance Program](https://www.harrishealth.org/en/patients/access-care/eligibility-card/pages/default.aspx)  (known colloquially as the "Gold Card") is a healthcare discount.
- Eligibility Office: 713 566 6509, dial 4 then 1 
	- Tips for the phone call:
		- You'll probably talk to Troy, the supervisor.
		- They will ask for the client's name and DOB.
		- Ask for the **application number** and the **eligibility counselor**.
		- Find out the **[eligibility location](https://www.harrishealth.org/en/patients/access-care/eligibility-card/pages/eligibility-locations.aspx)** that's handling the case.
- [Harris Health Contact Information](https://www.harrishealth.org/en/contact-us/pages/default.aspx)
- [Applications](https://www.harrishealth.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/eligibility/applicant-forms/English/application-instructions-english.pdf) are mailed to P.O. Box 300488 Houston TX 77230
- Don't forget to sign a [release of information](https://www.harrishealth.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/medical-record-authorization-english.pdf) if you want to call on the client's behalf!
- The applications *require* many supporting documents (but *not* the Medicare assets form). It's easiest to apply for single adults. If possible, include as few household members on the application as possible. For *every* household member, Harris Health will ask for a proof of familial relations---these documents can be tricky to locate in time if a client has a serious medical need. 
	- proof of identity
		- government issued photo ID
	- proof of gross income (last 30 days)
		- statement of support,

## Vision
| Plan | Eye Doctors? | Vision Benfit?  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Medicaid | yes | yes |
| STAR Plans | yes | yes | 
| RMA | yes | **no** |
| Gold Card | yes | **no** |
| Healthcare.gov | yes | maybe |

Because RMA and Gold Card do not provide vision benefits (the client can get a prescription, but won't get coverage for the actual frames and lenses), you'll need to rely on one of two charity organizations: [OneSight](https://rma.pointcomfort.com/files/OneSight%20Voucher%20Program%20Intro.pdf) and [Prevent Blindness of Texas](http://texas.preventblindness.org/request-our-eye-care-referral-services-0). We've used the OneSight program (with LensCrafters) since 2/1/2017. *Use the OneSight Program the Galleria LensCrafters runs out of vouchers.*

### OneSight Program

1. Send the client to an optometrist for an eye exam and a lens prescription.
2. Call [LensCrafters at the Galleria](https://www.google.com/maps/place/LensCrafters/@29.736271,-95.463985,15z/), 713-623-0855, and ask for a OneSight appointment (usually made only on Tues & Thurs).
3. Fill and sign the appropriate referral:
	- [Cuban/Haitan Entrants](materials/onesightcuban.pdf)
	- [Refugees](materials/onesightrefugee.pdf)
	- [VOTs](materials/onesightvot.pdf)
	- [SIV Holders](materials/onesightsiv.pdf)
	- [Asylees](materials/onesightasylee.pdf)
4. Send the client with the referral and prescription for the OneSight appointment time. A client with basic English can go alone. The client will get to pick from a limited selection of frames. 
5. LensCrafters will make the glasses in 2 weeks then call and ask the client to pick them up. 

### Prevent Blindness of Texas
When LensCrafters runs out of OneSight vouchers, complete one of the following voucher applications and fax it to Prevent Blindness of Texas, 713-529-8310. *Once the client obtains a voucher, reach out to LensCrafters for a OneSight appointment, as outlined about.*
